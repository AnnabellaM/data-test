A\nfeature of HTTP is the typing of data representation, allowing systems to be\nbuilt independently of the data being transferred.\nHTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since\n1990. This specification reflects common usage of the protocol referred to as\n\"HTTP/1.0\".\n***** Table of Contents *****\n1.

Introduction *****\n**** 1.1 Purpose ****\nThe Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol with\nthe lightness and speed necessary for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia\ninformation systems. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global\ninformation initiative since 1990. This specification reflects common usage of\nthe protocol referred to as \"HTTP/1.0\". This specification describes the\nfeatures that seem to be consistently implemented in most HTTP/1.0 clients and\nservers. The specification is split into two sections. Those features of HTTP\nfor which implementations are usually consistent are described in the main body\nof this document. Those features which have few or inconsistent implementations\nare listed in Appendix_D.\nPractical information systems require more functionality than simple retrieval,\nincluding search, front-end update, and annotation. HTTP allows an open-ended\nset of methods to be used to indicate the purpose of a request. It builds on\nthe discipline of reference provided by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n[2], as a location (URL)[4] or name (URN)[16], for indicating the resource on\nwhich a method is to be applied. Messages are passed in a format similar to\nthat used by Internet Mail[7] and the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions\n(MIME)[5].\nHTTP is also used as a generic protocol for communication between user agents\nand proxies/gateways to other Internet protocols, such as SMTP[12], NNTP[11],\nFTP[14], Gopher[1], and WAIS[8], allowing basic hypermedia access to resources\navailable from diverse applications and simplifying the implementation of user\nagents.\n**** 1.2 Terminology ****\nThis specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles played by\nparticipants in, and objects of, the HTTP communication.\n  connection\n      A transport layer virtual circuit established between two application\n      programs for the purpose of communication.\n  message\n      The basic unit of HTTP communication, consisting of a structured sequence\n      of octets matching the syntax defined in Section_4 and transmitted via\n      the connection.\n  request\n      An HTTP request message (as defined in Section_5).\n  response\n      An HTTP response message (as defined in Section_6).\n  resource\n      A network data object or service which can be identified by a URI\n      (Section_3.2).\n  entity\n      A particular representation or rendition of a data resource, or reply\n      from a service resource, that may be enclosed within a request or\n      response message. An entity consists of metainformation in the form of\n      entity headers and content in the form of an entity body.\n  client\n      An application program that establishes connections for the purpose of\n      sending requests.\n  user agent\n      The client which initiates a request. These are often browsers, editors,\n      spiders (web-traversing robots), or other end user tools.\n  server\n      An application program that accepts connections in order to service\n      requests by sending back responses.\n  origin server\n      The server on which a given resource resides or is to be created.\n  proxy\n      An intermediary program which acts as both a server and a client for the\n      purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients. Requests are\n      serviced internally or by passing them, with possible translation, on to\n      other servers. A proxy must interpret and, if necessary, rewrite a\n      request message before forwarding it. Proxies are often used as client-\n      side portals through network firewalls and as helper applications for\n      handling requests via protocols not implemented by the user agent.\n  gateway\n      A server which acts as an intermediary for some other server. Unlike a\n      proxy, a gateway receives requests as if it were the origin server for\n      the requested resource; the requesting client may not be aware that it is\n      communicating with a gateway. Gateways are often used as server-side\n      portals through network firewalls and as protocol translators for access\n      to resources stored on non-HTTP systems.\n  tunnel\n      A tunnel is an intermediary program which is acting as a blind relay\n      between two connections. Once active, a tunnel is not considered a party\n      to the HTTP communication, though the tunnel may have been initiated by\n      an HTTP request. The tunnel ceases to exist when both ends of the relayed\n      connections are closed. Tunnels are used when a portal is necessary and\n      the intermediary cannot, or should not, interpret the relayed\n      communication.\n  cache\n      A program's local store of response messages and the subsystem that\n      controls its message storage, retrieval, and deletion. A cache stores\n      cachable responses in order to reduce the response time and network\n      bandwidth consumption on future, equivalent requests. Any client or\n      server may include a cache, though a cache cannot be used by a server\n      while it is acting as a tunnel.\nAny given program may be capable of being both a client and a server; our use\nof these terms refers only to the role being performed by the program for a\nparticular connection, rather than to the program's capabilities in general.\nLikewise, any server may act as an origin server, proxy, gateway, or tunnel,\nswitching behavior based on the nature of each request.\n**** 1.3 Overall Operation ****\nThe HTTP protocol is based on a request/response paradigm. A client establishes\na connection with a server and sends a request to the server in the form of a\nrequest method, URI, and protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message\ncontaining request modifiers, client information, and possible body content.\nThe server responds with a status line, including the message's protocol\nversion and a success or error code, followed by a MIME-like message containing\nserver information, entity metainformation, and possible body content.\nMost HTTP communication is initiated by a user agent and consists of a request\nto be applied to a resource on some origin server. In the simplest case, this\nmay be accomplished via a single connection (v) between the user agent (UA) and\nthe origin server (O).\n       request chain ------------------------>\n    UA -------------------v------------------- O\n       <----------------------- response chain\nA more complicated situation occurs when one or more intermediaries are present\nin the request/response chain. There are three common forms of intermediary:\nproxy, gateway, and tunnel. A proxy is a forwarding agent, receiving requests\nfor a URI in its absolute form, rewriting all or parts of the message, and\nforwarding the reformatted request toward the server identified by the URI. A\ngateway is a receiving agent, acting as a layer above some other server(s) and,\nif necessary, translating the requests to the underlying server's protocol. A\ntunnel acts as a relay point between two connections without changing the\nmessages; tunnels are used when the communication needs to pass through an\nintermediary (such as a firewall) even when the intermediary cannot understand\nthe contents of the messages.\n       request chain -------------------------------------->\n    UA -----v----- A -----v----- B -----v----- C -----v----- O\n       <------------------------------------- response chain\nThe figure above shows three intermediaries (A, B, and C) between the user\nagent and origin server. A request or response message that travels the whole\nchain must pass through four separate connections. This distinction is\nimportant because some HTTP communication options may apply only to the\nconnection with the nearest, non-tunnel neighbor, only to the end-points of the\nchain, or to all connections along the chain. Although the diagram is linear,\neach participant may be engaged in multiple, simultaneous communications. For\nexample, B may be receiving requests from many clients other than A, and/or\nforwarding requests to servers other than C, at the same time that it is\nhandling A's request.\nAny party to the communication which is not acting as a tunnel may employ an\ninternal cache for handling requests. The effect of a cache is that the\nrequest/response chain is shortened if one of the participants along the chain\nhas a cached response applicable to that request. The following illustrates the\nresulting chain if B has a cached copy of an earlier response from O (via C)\nfor a request which has not been cached by UA or A.\n       request chain ---------->\n    UA -----v----- A -----v----- B - - - - - - C - - - - - - O\n       <--------- response chain\nNot all responses are cachable, and some requests may contain modifiers which\nplace special requirements on cache behavior. Some HTTP/1.0 applications use\nheuristics to describe what is or is not a \"cachable\" response, but these rules\nare not standardized.\nOn the Internet, HTTP communication generally takes place over TCP/IP\nconnections. The default port is TCP 80[15], but other ports can be used. This\ndoes not preclude HTTP from being implemented on top of any other protocol on\nthe Internet, or on other networks. HTTP only presumes a reliable transport;\nany protocol that provides such guarantees can be used, and the mapping of the\nHTTP/1.0 request and response structures onto the transport data units of the\nprotocol in question is outside the scope of this specification.\nExcept for experimental applications, current practice requires that the\nconnection be established by the client prior to each request and closed by the\nserver after sending the response. Both clients and servers should be aware\nthat either party may close the connection prematurely, due to user action,\nautomated time-out, or program failure, and should handle such closing in a\npredictable fashion. In any case, the closing of the connection by either or\nboth parties always terminates the current request, regardless of its status.\n**** 1.4 HTTP and MIME ****\nHTTP/1.0 uses many of the constructs defined for MIME, as defined in RFC 1521\n[5]. Appendix_C describes the ways in which the context of HTTP allows for\ndifferent use of Internet Media Types than is typically found in Internet mail,\nand gives the rationale for those differences.\n***** 2. Notational Conventions and Generic Grammar *****\n**** 2.1 Augmented BNF ****\nAll of the mechanisms specified in this document are described in both prose\nand an augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) similar to that used by RFC 822[7].\nImplementors will need to be familiar with the notation in order to understand\nthis specification. The augmented BNF includes the following constructs:\n  name = definition\n      The name of a rule is simply the name itself (without any enclosing \"<\"\n      and \">\") and is separated from its definition by the equal character \"=\".\n      Whitespace is only significant in that indentation of continuation lines\n      is used to indicate a rule definition that spans more than one line.\n      Certain basic rules are in uppercase, such as SP, LWS, HT, CRLF, DIGIT,\n      ALPHA, etc. Angle brackets are used within definitions whenever their\n      presence will facilitate discerning the use of rule names.\n  \"literal\"\n      Quotation marks surround literal text. Unless stated otherwise, the text\n      is case-insensitive.\n  rule1 | rule2\n      Elements separated by a bar (\"I\") are alternatives, e.g., \"yes | no\" will\n      accept yes or no.\n  (rule1 rule2)\n      Elements enclosed in parentheses are treated as a single element. Thus, \"\n      (elem (foo | bar) elem)\" allows the token sequences \"elem foo elem\" and\n      \"elem bar elem\".\n  *rule\n      The character \"*\" preceding an element indicates repetition. The full\n      form is \"<n>*<m>element\" indicating at least <n> and at most <m>\n      occurrences of element. Default values are 0 and infinity so that \"*\n      (element)\" allows any number, including zero; \"1*element\" requires at\n      least one; and \"1*2element\" allows one or two.\n  [rule]\n      Square brackets enclose optional elements; \"[foo bar]\" is equivalent to\n      \"*1(foo bar)\".\n  N rule\n      Specific repetition: \"<n>(element)\" is equivalent to \"<n>*<n>(element)\";\n      that is, exactly <n> occurrences of (element). Thus 2DIGIT is a 2-digit\n      number, and 3ALPHA is a string of three alphabetic characters.\n  #rule\n      A construct \"#\" is defined, similar to \"*\", for defining lists of\n      elements. The full form is \"<n>#<m>element\" indicating at least <n> and\n      at most <m> elements, each separated by one or more commas (\",\") and\n      optional linear whitespace (LWS). This makes the usual form of lists very\n      easy; a rule such as \"( *LWS element *( *LWS \",\" *LWS element ))\" can be\n      shown as \"1#element\". Wherever this construct is used, null elements are\n      allowed, but do not contribute to the count of elements present. That is,\n      \"(element), , (element)\" is permitted, but counts as only two elements.\n      Therefore, where at least one element is required, at least one non-null\n      element must be present. Default values are 0 and infinity so that \"#\n      (element)\" allows any number, including zero; \"1#element\" requires at\n      least one; and \"1#2element\" allows one or two.\n  ; comment\n      A semi-colon, set off some distance to the right of rule text, starts a\n      comment that continues to the end of line. This is a simple way of\n      including useful notes in parallel with the specifications.\n  implied *LWS\n      The grammar described by this specification is word-based. Except where\n      noted otherwise, linear whitespace (LWS) can be included between any two\n      adjacent words (token or quoted-string), and between adjacent tokens and\n      delimiters (tspecials), without changing the interpretation of a field.\n      At least one delimiter (tspecials) must exist between any two tokens,\n      since they would otherwise be interpreted as a single token. However,\n      applications should attempt to follow \"common form\" when generating HTTP\n      constructs, since there exist some implementations that fail to accept\n      anything beyond the common forms.\n**** 2.2 Basic Rules ****\nThe following rules are used throughout this specification to describe basic\nparsing constructs. The US-ASCII coded character set is defined by[17].\n       OCTET          = <any 8-bit sequence of data>\n       CHAR           = <any US-ASCII character (octets 0 - 127)>\n       UPALPHA        = <any US-ASCII uppercase letter \"A\"..\"Z\">\n       LOALPHA        = <any US-ASCII lowercase letter \"a\"..\"z\">\n       ALPHA          = UPALPHA | LOALPHA\n       DIGIT          = <any US-ASCII digit \"0\"..\"9\">\n       CTL            = <any US-ASCII control character\n                        (octets 0 - 31) and DEL (127)>\n       CR             = <US-ASCII CR, carriage return (13)>\n       LF             = <US-ASCII LF, linefeed (10)>\n       SP             = <US-ASCII SP, space (32)>\n       HT             = <US-ASCII HT, horizontal-tab (9)>\n       <\">            = <US-ASCII double-quote mark (34)>\nHTTP/1.0 defines the octet sequence CR LF as the end-of-line marker for all\nprotocol elements except the Entity-Body (see Appendix_B for tolerant\napplications). The end-of-line marker within an Entity-Body is defined by its\nassociated media type, as described in Section_3.6.\n       CRLF           = CR LF\nHTTP/1.0 headers may be folded onto multiple lines if each continuation line\nbegins with a space or horizontal tab. All linear whitespace, including\nfolding, has the same semantics as SP.\n       LWS            = [CRLF] 1*( SP | HT )\nHowever, folding of header lines is not expected by some applications, and\nshould not be generated by HTTP/1.0 applications.\nThe TEXT rule is only used for descriptive field contents and values that are\nnot intended to be interpreted by the message parser. Words of *TEXT may\ncontain octets from character sets other than US-ASCII.\n       TEXT           = <any OCTET except CTLs,\n                        but including LWS>\nRecipients of header field TEXT containing octets outside the US-ASCII\ncharacter set may assume that they represent ISO-8859-1 characters.\nHexadecimal numeric characters are used in several protocol elements.\n       HEX            = \"A\" | \"B\" | \"C\" | \"D\" | \"E\" | \"F\"\n                      | \"a\" | \"b\" | \"c\" | \"d\" | \"e\" | \"f\" | DIGIT\nMany HTTP/1.0 header field values consist of words separated by LWS or special\ncharacters. These special characters must be in a quoted string to be used\nwithin a parameter value.\n       word           = token | quoted-string\n       token          = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or tspecials>\n       tspecials      = \"(\" | \")\" | \"<\" | \">\" | \"@\"\n                      | \",\" | \";\" | \":\" | \"\\\" | <\">\n                      | \"/\" | \"[\" | \"]\" | \"?\" | \"=\"\n                      | \"{\" | \"}\" | SP | HT\nComments may be included in some HTTP header fields by surrounding the comment\ntext with parentheses. Comments are only allowed in fields containing \"comment\"\nas part of their field value definition. In all other fields, parentheses are\nconsidered part of the field value.\n       comment        = \"(\" *( ctext | comment ) \")\"\n       ctext          = <any TEXT excluding \"(\" and \")\">\nA string of text is parsed as a single word if it is quoted using double-quote\nmarks.\n       quoted-string  = ( <\"> *(qdtext) <\"> )\n       qdtext         = <any CHAR except <\"> and CTLs,\n                        but including LWS>\nSingle-character quoting using the backslash (\"\\\") character is not permitted\nin HTTP/1.0.\n***** 3. Protocol Parameters *****\n**** 3.1 HTTP Version ****\nHTTP uses a \"<major>.<minor>\" numbering scheme to indicate versions of the\nprotocol. The protocol versioning policy is intended to allow the sender to\nindicate the format of a message and its capacity for understanding further\nHTTP communication, rather than the features obtained via that communication.\nNo change is made to the version number for the addition of message components\nwhich do not affect communication behavior or which only add to extensible\nfield values. The <minor> number is incremented when the changes made to the\nprotocol add features which do not change the general message parsing\nalgorithm, but which may add to the message semantics and imply additional\ncapabilities of the sender. The <major> number is incremented when the format\nof a message within the protocol is changed.\nThe version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field in the\nfirst line of the message. If the protocol version is not specified, the\nrecipient must assume that the message is in the simple HTTP/0.9 format.\n       HTTP-Version   = \"HTTP\" \"/\" 1*DIGIT \".\" 1*DIGIT\nNote that the major and minor numbers should be treated as separate integers\nand that each may be incremented higher than a single digit. Thus, HTTP/2.4 is\na lower version than HTTP/2.13, which in turn is lower than HTTP/12.3. Leading\nzeros should be ignored by recipients and never generated by senders.\nThis document defines both the 0.9 and 1.0 versions of the HTTP protocol.\nApplications sending Full-Request or Full-Response messages, as defined by this\nspecification, must include an HTTP-Version of \"HTTP/1.0\".\nHTTP/1.0 servers must:\n    * recognize the format of the Request-Line for HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0\n      requests;\n    * understand any valid request in the format of HTTP/0.9 or HTTP/1.0;\n    * respond appropriately with a message in the same protocol version used by\n      the client.\nHTTP/1.0 clients must:\n    * recognize the format of the Status-Line for HTTP/1.0 responses;\n    * understand any valid response in the format of HTTP/0.9 or HTTP/1.0.\nProxy and gateway applications must be careful in forwarding requests that are\nreceived in a format different than that of the application's native HTTP\nversion. Since the protocol version indicates the protocol capability of the\nsender, a proxy/gateway must never send a message with a version indicator\nwhich is greater than its native version; if a higher version request is\nreceived, the proxy/gateway must either downgrade the request version or\nrespond with an error. Requests with a version lower than that of the\napplication's native format may be upgraded before being forwarded; the proxy/\ngateway's response to that request must follow the server requirements listed\nabove.\n**** 3.2 Uniform Resource Identifiers ****\nURIs have been known by many names: WWW addresses, Universal Document\nIdentifiers, Universal Resource Identifiers[2], and finally the combination of\nUniform Resource Locators (URL)[4] and Names (URN)[16]. As far as HTTP is\nconcerned, Uniform Resource Identifiers are simply formatted strings which\nidentify--via name, location, or any other characteristic--a network resource.\n*** 3.2.1 General Syntax ***\nURIs in HTTP can be represented in absolute form or relative to some known base\nURI[9], depending upon the context of their use. The two forms are\ndifferentiated by the fact that absolute URIs always begin with a scheme name\nfollowed by a colon.\n       URI            = ( absoluteURI | relativeURI ) [ \"#\" fragment ]\n       absoluteURI    = scheme \":\" *( uchar | reserved )\n       relativeURI    = net_path | abs_path | rel_path\n       net_path       = \"//\" net_loc [ abs_path ]\n       abs_path       = \"/\" rel_path\n       rel_path       = [ path ] [ \";\" params ] [ \"?\" query ]\n       path           = fsegment *( \"/\" segment )\n       fsegment       = 1*pchar\n       segment        = *pchar\n       params         = param *( \";\" param )\n       param          = *( pchar | \"/\" )\n       scheme         = 1*( ALPHA | DIGIT | \"+\" | \"-\" | \".\" )\n       net_loc        = *( pchar | \";\" | \"?\" )\n       query          = *( uchar | reserved )\n       fragment       = *( uchar | reserved )\n       pchar          = uchar | \":\" | \"@\" | \"&\" | \"=\" | \"+\"\n       uchar          = unreserved | escape\n       unreserved     = ALPHA | DIGIT | safe | extra | national\n       escape         = \"%\" HEX HEX\n       reserved       = \";\" | \"/\" | \"?\" | \":\" | \"@\" | \"&\" | \"=\" | \"+\"\n       extra          = \"!\" | \"*\" | \"'\" | \"(\" | \")\" | \",\"\n       safe           = \"$\" | \"-\" | \"_\" | \".\"\n       unsafe         = CTL | SP | <\"> | \"#\" | \"%\" | \"<\" | \">\"\n       national       = <any OCTET excluding ALPHA, DIGIT,\n                        reserved, extra, safe, and unsafe>\nFor definitive information on URL syntax and semantics, see RFC 1738[4] and RFC\n1808[9]. The BNF above includes national characters not allowed in valid URLs\nas specified by RFC 1738, since HTTP servers are not restricted in the set of\nunreserved characters allowed to represent the rel_path part of addresses, and\nHTTP proxies may receive requests for URIs not defined by RFC 1738.\n*** 3.2.2 http URL ***\nThe \"http\" scheme is used to locate network resources via the HTTP protocol.\nThis section defines the scheme-specific syntax and semantics for http URLs.\n       http_URL       = \"http:\" \"//\" host [ \":\" port ] [ abs_path ]\n       host           = <A legal Internet host domain name\n                         or IP address (in dotted-decimal form),\n                         as defined by Section 2.1 of RFC 1123>\n       port           = *DIGIT\nIf the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed. The semantics are that\nthe identified resource is located at the server listening for TCP connections\non that port of that host, and the Request-URI for the resource is abs_path. If\nthe abs_path is not present in the URL, it must be given as \"/\" when used as a\nRequest-URI (Section_5.1.2).\n     Note: Although the HTTP protocol is independent of the transport\n     layer protocol, the http URL only identifies resources by their TCP\n     location, and thus non-TCP resources must be identified by some other\n     URI scheme.\nThe canonical form for \"http\" URLs is obtained by converting any UPALPHA\ncharacters in host to their LOALPHA equivalent (hostnames are case-\ninsensitive), eliding the [ \":\" port ] if the port is 80, and replacing an\nempty abs_path with \"/\".\n**** 3.3 Date/Time Formats ****\nHTTP/1.0 applications have historically allowed three different formats for the\nrepresentation of date/time stamps:\n       Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT    ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123\n       Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT   ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036\n       Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994         ; ANSI C's asctime() format\nThe first format is preferred as an Internet standard and represents a fixed-\nlength subset of that defined by RFC 1123[6] (an update to RFC 822[7]). The\nsecond format is in common use, but is based on the obsolete RFC 850[10] date\nformat and lacks a four-digit year. HTTP/1.0 clients and servers that parse the\ndate value should accept all three formats, though they must never generate the\nthird (asctime) format.\n     Note: Recipients of date values are encouraged to be robust in\n     accepting date values that may have been generated by non-HTTP\n     applications, as is sometimes the case when retrieving or posting\n     messages via proxies/gateways to SMTP or NNTP.\nAll HTTP/1.0 date/time stamps must be represented in Universal Time (UT), also\nknown as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception. This is indicated in the\nfirst two formats by the inclusion of \"GMT\" as the three-letter abbreviation\nfor time zone, and should be assumed when reading the asctime format.\n       HTTP-date      = rfc1123-date | rfc850-date | asctime-date\n       rfc1123-date   = wkday \",\" SP date1 SP time SP \"GMT\"\n       rfc850-date    = weekday \",\" SP date2 SP time SP \"GMT\"\n       asctime-date   = wkday SP date3 SP time SP 4DIGIT\n       date1          = 2DIGIT SP month SP 4DIGIT\n                        ; day month year (e.g., 02 Jun 1982)\n       date2          = 2DIGIT \"-\" month \"-\" 2DIGIT\n                        ; day-month-year (e.g., 02-Jun-82)\n       date3          = month SP ( 2DIGIT | ( SP 1DIGIT ))\n                        ; month day (e.g., Jun  2)\n       time           = 2DIGIT \":\" 2DIGIT \":\" 2DIGIT\n                        ; 00:00:00 - 23:59:59\n       wkday          = \"Mon\" | \"Tue\" | \"Wed\"\n                      | \"Thu\" | \"Fri\" | \"Sat\" | \"Sun\"\n       weekday        = \"Monday\" | \"Tuesday\" | \"Wednesday\"\n                      | \"Thursday\" | \"Friday\" | \"Saturday\" | \"Sunday\"\n       month          = \"Jan\" | \"Feb\" | \"Mar\" | \"Apr\"\n                      | \"May\" | \"Jun\" | \"Jul\" | \"Aug\"\n                      | \"Sep\" | \"Oct\" | \"Nov\" | \"Dec\"\n     Note: HTTP requirements for the date/time stamp format apply only to\n     their usage within the protocol stream. Clients and servers are not\n     required to use these formats for user presentation, request logging,\n     etc.\n**** 3.4 Character Sets ****\nHTTP uses the same definition of the term \"character set\" as that described for\nMIME:\n     The term \"character set\" is used in this document to refer to a\n     method used with one or more tables to convert a sequence of octets\n     into a sequence of characters. Note that unconditional conversion in\n     the other direction is not required, in that not all characters may\n     be available in a given character set and a character set may provide\n     more than one sequence of octets to represent a particular character.\n     This definition is intended to allow various kinds of character\n     encodings, from simple single-table mappings such as US-ASCII to\n     complex table switching methods such as those that use ISO 2022's\n     techniques. However, the definition associated with a MIME character\n     set name must fully specify the mapping to be performed from octets\n     to characters. In particular, use of external profiling information\n     to determine the exact mapping is not permitted.\n     Note: This use of the term \"character set\" is more commonly referred\n     to as a \"character encoding.\" However, since HTTP and MIME share the\n     same registry, it is important that the terminology also be shared.\nHTTP character sets are identified by case-insensitive tokens. The complete set\nof tokens are defined by the IANA Character Set registry[15]. However, because\nthat registry does not define a single, consistent token for each character\nset, we define here the preferred names for those character sets most likely to\nbe used with HTTP entities. These character sets include those registered by\nRFC 1521[5] -- the US-ASCII[17] and ISO-8859[18] character sets -- and other\nnames specifically recommended for use within MIME charset parameters.\n       charset = \"US-ASCII\"\n               | \"ISO-8859-1\" | \"ISO-8859-2\" | \"ISO-8859-3\"\n               | \"ISO-8859-4\" | \"ISO-8859-5\" | \"ISO-8859-6\"\n               | \"ISO-8859-7\" | \"ISO-8859-8\" | \"ISO-8859-9\"\n               | \"ISO-2022-JP\" | \"ISO-2022-JP-2\" | \"ISO-2022-KR\"\n               | \"UNICODE-1-1\" | \"UNICODE-1-1-UTF-7\" | \"UNICODE-1-1-UTF-8\"\n               | token\nAlthough HTTP allows an arbitrary token to be used as a charset value, any\ntoken that has a predefined value within the IANA Character Set registry[15]\nmust represent the character set defined by that registry. Applications should\nlimit their use of character sets to those defined by the IANA registry.\nThe character set of an entity body should be labelled as the lowest common\ndenominator of the character codes used within that body, with the exception\nthat no label is preferred over the labels US-ASCII or ISO-8859-1.\n**** 3.5 Content Codings ****\nContent coding values are used to indicate an encoding transformation that has\nbeen applied to a resource. Content codings are primarily used to allow a\ndocument to be compressed or encrypted without losing the identity of its\nunderlying media type. Typically, the resource is stored in this encoding and\nonly decoded before rendering or analogous usage.\n       content-coding          = \"x-gzip\" | \"x-compress\" | token\n     Note: For future compatibility, HTTP/1.0 applications should consider\n     \"gzip\" and \"compress\" to be equivalent to \"x-gzip\" and \"x-compress\",\n     respectively.\nAll content-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.0 uses content-coding\nvalues in the Content-Encoding (Section_10.3) header field. Although the value\ndescribes the content-coding, what is more important is that it indicates what\ndecoding mechanism will be required to remove the encoding. Note that a single\nprogram may be capable of decoding multiple content-coding formats. Two values\nare defined by this specification:\n  x-gzip\n      An encoding format produced by the file compression program \"gzip\" (GNU\n      zip) developed by Jean-loup Gailly. This format is typically a Lempel-Ziv\n      coding (LZ77) with a 32 bit CRC.\n  x-compress\n      The encoding format produced by the file compression program \"compress\".\n      This format is an adaptive Lempel-Ziv-Welch coding (LZW).\n     Note: Use of program names for the identification of encoding formats\n     is not desirable and should be discouraged for future encodings.\n     Their use here is representative of historical practice, not good\n     design.\n**** 3.6 Media Types ****\nHTTP uses Internet Media Types[13] in the Content-Type header field (Section\n10.5) in order to provide open and extensible data typing.\n       media-type     = type \"/\" subtype *( \";\" parameter )\n       type           = token\n       subtype        = token\nParameters may follow the type/subtype in the form of attribute/value pairs.\n       parameter      = attribute \"=\" value\n       attribute      = token\n       value          = token | quoted-string\nThe type, subtype, and parameter attribute names are case-insensitive.\nParameter values may or may not be case-sensitive, depending on the semantics\nof the parameter name. LWS must not be generated between the type and subtype,\nnor between an attribute and its value. Upon receipt of a media type with an\nunrecognized parameter, a user agent should treat the media type as if the\nunrecognized parameter and its value were not present.\nSome older HTTP applications do not recognize media type parameters. HTTP/1.0\napplications should only use media type parameters when they are necessary to\ndefine the content of a message.\nMedia-type values are registered with the Internet Assigned Number Authority\n(IANA[15]). The media type registration process is outlined in RFC 1590[13].\nUse of non-registered media types is discouraged.\n*** 3.6.1 Canonicalization and Text Defaults ***\nInternet media types are registered with a canonical form. In general, an\nEntity-Body transferred via HTTP must be represented in the appropriate\ncanonical form prior to its transmission. If the body has been encoded with a\nContent-Encoding, the underlying data should be in canonical form prior to\nbeing encoded.\nMedia subtypes of the \"text\" type use CRLF as the text line break when in\ncanonical form. However, HTTP allows the transport of text media with plain CR\nor LF alone representing a line break when used consistently within the Entity-\nBody. HTTP applications must accept CRLF, bare CR, and bare LF as being\nrepresentative of a line break in text media received via HTTP.\nIn addition, if the text media is represented in a character set that does not\nuse octets 13 and 10 for CR and LF respectively, as is the case for some multi-\nbyte character sets, HTTP allows the use of whatever octet sequences are\ndefined by that character set to represent the equivalent of CR and LF for line\nbreaks. This flexibility regarding line breaks applies only to text media in\nthe Entity-Body; a bare CR or LF should not be substituted for CRLF within any\nof the HTTP control structures (such as header fields and multipart\nboundaries).\nThe \"charset\" parameter is used with some media types to define the character\nset (Section_3.4) of the data. When no explicit charset parameter is provided\nby the sender, media subtypes of the \"text\" type are defined to have a default\ncharset value of \"ISO-8859-1\" when received via HTTP. Data in character sets\nother than \"ISO-8859-1\" or its subsets must be labelled with an appropriate\ncharset value in order to be consistently interpreted by the recipient.\n     Note: Many current HTTP servers provide data using charsets other\n     than \"ISO-8859-1\" without proper labelling. This situation reduces\n     interoperability and is not recommended. To compensate for this, some\n     HTTP user agents provide a configuration option to allow the user to\n     change the default interpretation of the media type character set\n     when no charset parameter is given.\n*** 3.6.2 Multipart Types ***\nMIME provides for a number of \"multipart\" types -- encapsulations of several\nentities within a single message's Entity-Body. The multipart types registered\nby IANA[15] do not have any special meaning for HTTP/1.0, though user agents\nmay need to understand each type in order to correctly interpret the purpose of\neach body-part. An HTTP user agent should follow the same or similar behavior\nas a MIME user agent does upon receipt of a multipart type. HTTP servers should\nnot assume that all HTTP clients are prepared to handle multipart types.\nAll multipart types share a common syntax and must include a boundary parameter\nas part of the media type value. The message body is itself a protocol element\nand must therefore use only CRLF to represent line breaks between body-parts.\nMultipart body-parts may contain HTTP header fields which are significant to\nthe meaning of that part.\n**** 3.7 Product Tokens ****\nProduct tokens are used to allow communicating applications to identify\nthemselves via a simple product token, with an optional slash and version\ndesignator. Most fields using product tokens also allow subproducts which form\na significant part of the application to be listed, separated by whitespace. By\nconvention, the products are listed in order of their significance for\nidentifying the application.\n       product         = token [\"/\" product-version]\n       product-version = token\nExamples:\n       User-Agent: CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3\n\n       Server: Apache/0.8.4\nProduct tokens should be short and to the point -- use of them for advertizing\nor other non-essential information is explicitly forbidden. Although any token\ncharacter may appear in a product-version, this token should only be used for a\nversion identifier (i.e., successive versions of the same product should only\ndiffer in the product-version portion of the product value).\n***** 4. HTTP Message *****\n**** 4.1 Message Types ****\nHTTP messages consist of requests from client to server and responses from\nserver to client.\n       HTTP-message   = Simple-Request            ; HTTP/0.9 messages\n                      | Simple-Response\n                      | Full-Request              ; HTTP/1.0 messages\n                      | Full-Response\nFull-Request and Full-Response use the generic message format of RFC 822[7] for\ntransferring entities. Both messages may include optional header fields (also\nknown as \"headers\") and an entity body. The entity body is separated from the\nheaders by a null line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF).\n       Full-Request   = Request-Line              ; Section_5.1\n                        *( General-Header         ; Section_4.3\n                         | Request-Header         ; Section_5.2\n                         | Entity-Header )        ; Section_7.1\n                        CRLF\n                        [ Entity-Body ]           ; Section_7.2\n       Full-Response  = Status-Line               ; Section_6.1\n                        *( General-Header         ; Section_4.3\n                         | Response-Header        ; Section_6.2\n                         | Entity-Header )        ; Section_7.1\n                        CRLF\n                        [ Entity-Body ]           ; Section_7.2\nSimple-Request and Simple-Response do not allow the use of any header\ninformation and are limited to a single request method (GET).\n       Simple-Request  = \"GET\" SP Request-URI CRLF\n       Simple-Response = [ Entity-Body ]\nUse of the Simple-Request format is discouraged because it prevents the server\nfrom identifying the media type of the returned entity.\n**** 4.2 Message Headers ****\nHTTP header fields, which include General-Header (Section_4.3), Request-Header\n(Section_5.2), Response-Header (Section_6.2), and Entity-Header (Section_7.1)\nfields, follow the same generic format as that given in Section 3.1 of RFC 822\n[7]. Each header field consists of a name followed immediately by a colon (\":\n\"), a single space (SP) character, and the field value. Field names are case-\ninsensitive. Header fields can be extended over multiple lines by preceding\neach extra line with at least one SP or HT, though this is not recommended.\n       HTTP-header    = field-name \":\" [ field-value ] CRLF\n       field-name     = token\n       field-value    = *( field-content | LWS )\n       field-content  = <the OCTETs making up the field-value\n                        and consisting of either *TEXT or combinations\n                        of token, tspecials, and quoted-string>\nThe order in which header fields are received is not significant. However, it\nis \"good practice\" to send General-Header fields first, followed by Request-\nHeader or Response-Header fields prior to the Entity-Header fields.\nMultiple HTTP-header fields with the same field-name may be present in a\nmessage if and only if the entire field-value for that header field is defined\nas a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)]. It must be possible to combine the\nmultiple header fields into one \"field-name: field-value\" pair, without\nchanging the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field-value\nto the first, each separated by a comma.\n**** 4.3 General Header Fields ****\nThere are a few header fields which have general applicability for both request\nand response messages, but which do not apply to the entity being transferred.\nThese headers apply only to the message being transmitted.\n       General-Header = Date                     ; Section_10.6\n                      | Pragma                   ; Section_10.12\nGeneral header field names can be extended reliably only in combination with a\nchange in the protocol version. However, new or experimental header fields may\nbe given the semantics of general header fields if all parties in the\ncommunication recognize them to be general header fields. Unrecognized header\nfields are treated as Entity-Header fields.\n***** 5. Request *****\nA request message from a client to a server includes, within the first line of\nthat message, the method to be applied to the resource, the identifier of the\nresource, and the protocol version in use. For backwards compatibility with the\nmore limited HTTP/0.9 protocol, there are two valid formats for an HTTP\nrequest:\n       Request        = Simple-Request | Full-Request\n       Simple-Request = \"GET\" SP Request-URI CRLF\n       Full-Request   = Request-Line              ; Section_5.1\n                        *( General-Header         ; Section_4.3\n                         | Request-Header         ; Section_5.2\n                         | Entity-Header )        ; Section_7.1\n                        CRLF\n                        [ Entity-Body ]           ; Section_7.2\nIf an HTTP/1.0 server receives a Simple-Request, it must respond with an HTTP/\n0.9 Simple-Response. An HTTP/1.0 client capable of receiving a Full-Response\nshould never generate a Simple-Request.\n**** 5.1 Request-Line ****\nThe Request-Line begins with a method token, followed by the Request-URI and\nthe protocol version, and ending with CRLF. The elements are separated by SP\ncharacters. No CR or LF are allowed except in the final CRLF sequence.\n       Request-Line   = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF\nNote that the difference between a Simple-Request and the Request-Line of a\nFull-Request is the presence of the HTTP-Version field and the availability of\nmethods other than GET.\n*** 5.1.1 Method ***\nThe Method token indicates the method to be performed on the resource\nidentified by the Request-URI. The method is case-sensitive.\n       Method         = \"GET\"                    ; Section_8.1\n                      | \"HEAD\"                   ; Section_8.2\n                      | \"POST\"                   ; Section_8.3\n                      | extension-method\n       extension-method = token\nThe list of methods acceptable by a specific resource can change dynamically;\nthe client is notified through the return code of the response if a method is\nnot allowed on a resource. Servers should return the status code 501 (not\nimplemented) if the method is unrecognized or not implemented.\nThe methods commonly used by HTTP/1.0 applications are fully defined in Section\n8.\n*** 5.1.2 Request-URI ***\nThe Request-URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier (Section_3.2) and identifies\nthe resource upon which to apply the request.\n       Request-URI    = absoluteURI | abs_path\nThe two options for Request-URI are dependent on the nature of the request.\nThe absoluteURI form is only allowed when the request is being made to a proxy.\nThe proxy is requested to forward the request and return the response. If the\nrequest is GET or HEAD and a prior response is cached, the proxy may use the\ncached message if it passes any restrictions in the Expires header field. Note\nthat the proxy may forward the request on to another proxy or directly to the\nserver specified by the absoluteURI. In order to avoid request loops, a proxy\nmust be able to recognize all of its server names, including any aliases, local\nvariations, and the numeric IP address. An example Request-Line would be:\n       GET /TheProject.html HTTP/1.0\nThe most common form of Request-URI is that used to identify a resource on an\norigin server or gateway. In this case, only the absolute path of the URI is\ntransmitted (see Section_3.2.1, abs_path). For example, a client wishing to\nretrieve the resource above directly from the origin server would create a TCP\nconnection to port 80 of the host \"www.w3.org\" and send the line:\n       GET /pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.0\nfollowed by the remainder of the Full-Request. Note that the absolute path\ncannot be empty; if none is present in the original URI, it must be given as \"/\n\" (the server root).\nThe Request-URI is transmitted as an encoded string, where some characters may\nbe escaped using the \"% HEX HEX\" encoding defined by RFC 1738[4]. The origin\nserver must decode the Request-URI in order to properly interpret the request.\n**** 5.2 Request Header Fields ****\nThe request header fields allow the client to pass additional information about\nthe request, and about the client itself, to the server. These fields act as\nrequest modifiers, with semantics equivalent to the parameters on a programming\nlanguage method (procedure) invocation.\n       Request-Header = Authorization            ; Section_10.2\n                      | From                     ; Section_10.8\n                      | If-Modified-Since        ; Section_10.9\n                      | Referer                  ; Section_10.13\n                      | User-Agent               ; Section_10.15\nRequest-Header field names can be extended reliably only in combination with a\nchange in the protocol version. However, new or experimental header fields may\nbe given the semantics of request header fields if all parties in the\ncommunication recognize them to be request header fields. Unrecognized header\nfields are treated as Entity-Header fields.\n***** 6. Response *****\nAfter receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds in the\nform of an HTTP response message.\n       Response        = Simple-Response | Full-Response\n       Simple-Response = [ Entity-Body ]\n       Full-Response   = Status-Line              ; Section_6.1\n                         *( General-Header        ; Section_4.3\n                          | Response-Header       ; Section_6.2\n                          | Entity-Header )       ; Section_7.1\n                         CRLF\n                         [ Entity-Body ]          ; Section_7.2\nA Simple-Response should only be sent in response to an HTTP/0.9 Simple-Request\nor if the server only supports the more limited HTTP/0.9 protocol. If a client\nsends an HTTP/1.0 Full-Request and receives a response that does not begin with\na Status-Line, it should assume that the response is a Simple-Response and\nparse it accordingly. Note that the Simple-Response consists only of the entity\nbody and is terminated by the server closing the connection.\n**** 6.1 Status-Line ****\nThe first line of a Full-Response message is the Status-Line, consisting of the\nprotocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual\nphrase, with each element separated by SP characters. No CR or LF is allowed\nexcept in the final CRLF sequence.\n       Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF\nSince a status line always begins with the protocol version and status code\n       \"HTTP/\" 1*DIGIT \".\" 1*DIGIT SP 3DIGIT SP\n(e.g., \"HTTP/1.0 200 \"), the presence of that expression is sufficient to\ndifferentiate a Full-Response from a Simple-Response. Although the Simple-\nResponse format may allow such an expression to occur at the beginning of an\nentity body, and thus cause a misinterpretation of the message if it was given\nin response to a Full-Request, most HTTP/0.9 servers are limited to responses\nof type \"text/html\" and therefore would never generate such a response.\n*** 6.1.1 Status Code and Reason Phrase ***\nThe Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer result code of the attempt to\nunderstand and satisfy the request. The Reason-Phrase is intended to give a\nshort textual description of the Status-Code. The Status-Code is intended for\nuse by automata and the Reason-Phrase is intended for the human user. The\nclient is not required to examine or display the Reason-Phrase.\nThe first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response. The last two\ndigits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first\ndigit:\n    * 1xx: Informational - Not used, but reserved for future use\n    * 2xx: Success - The action was successfully received, understood, and\n      accepted.\n    * 3xx: Redirection - Further action must be taken in order to complete the\n      request\n    * 4xx: Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot be\n      fulfilled\n    * 5xx: Server Error - The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid\n      request\nThe individual values of the numeric status codes defined for HTTP/1.0, and an\nexample set of corresponding Reason-Phrase's, are presented below. The reason\nphrases listed here are only recommended -- they may be replaced by local\nequivalents without affecting the protocol. These codes are fully defined in\nSection_9.\n       Status-Code    = \"200\"   ; OK\n                      | \"201\"   ; Created\n                      | \"202\"   ; Accepted\n                      | \"204\"   ; No Content\n                      | \"301\"   ; Moved Permanently\n                      | \"302\"   ; Moved Temporarily\n                      | \"304\"   ; Not Modified\n                      | \"400\"   ; Bad Request\n                      | \"401\"   ; Unauthorized\n                      | \"403\"   ; Forbidden\n                      | \"404\"   ; Not Found\n                      | \"500\"   ; Internal Server Error\n                      | \"501\"   ; Not Implemented\n                      | \"502\"   ; Bad Gateway\n                      | \"503\"   ; Service Unavailable\n                      | extension-code\n       extension-code = 3DIGIT\n       Reason-Phrase  = *<TEXT, excluding CR, LF>\nHTTP status codes are extensible, but the above codes are the only ones\ngenerally recognized in current practice. HTTP applications are not required to\nunderstand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such\nunderstanding is obviously desirable. However, applications must understand the\nclass of any status code, as indicated by the first digit, and treat any\nunrecognized response as being equivalent to the x00 status code of that class,\nwith the exception that an unrecognized response must not be cached. For\nexample, if an unrecognized status code of 431 is received by the client, it\ncan safely assume that there was something wrong with its request and treat the\nresponse as if it had received a 400 status code. In such cases, user agents\nshould present to the user the entity returned with the response, since that\nentity is likely to include human-readable information which will explain the\nunusual status.\n**** 6.2 Response Header Fields ****\nThe response header fields allow the server to pass additional information\nabout the response which cannot be placed in the Status-Line. These header\nfields give information about the server and about further access to the\nresource identified by the Request-URI.\n       Response-Header = Location                ; Section_10.11\n                       | Server                  ; Section_10.14\n                       | WWW-Authenticate        ; Section_10.16\nResponse-Header field names can be extended reliably only in combination with a\nchange in the protocol version. However, new or experimental header fields may\nbe given the semantics of response header fields if all parties in the\ncommunication recognize them to be response header fields. Unrecognized header\nfields are treated as Entity-Header fields.\n***** 7. Entity *****\nFull-Request and Full-Response messages may transfer an entity within some\nrequests and responses. An entity consists of Entity-Header fields and\n(usually) an Entity-Body. In this section, both sender and recipient refer to\neither the client or the server, depending on who sends and who receives the\nentity.\n**** 7.1 Entity Header Fields ****\nEntity-Header fields define optional metainformation about the Entity-Body or,\nif no body is present, about the resource identified by the request.\n       Entity-Header  = Allow                    ; Section_10.1\n                      | Content-Encoding         ; Section_10.3\n                      | Content-Length           ; Section_10.4\n                      | Content-Type             ; Section_10.5\n                      | Expires                  ; Section_10.7\n                      | Last-Modified            ; Section_10.10\n                      | extension-header\n       extension-header = HTTP-header\nThe extension-header mechanism allows additional Entity-Header fields to be\ndefined without changing the protocol, but these fields cannot be assumed to be\nrecognizable by the recipient. Unrecognized header fields should be ignored by\nthe recipient and forwarded by proxies.\n**** 7.2 Entity Body ****\nThe entity body (if any) sent with an HTTP request or response is in a format\nand encoding defined by the Entity-Header fields.\n       Entity-Body    = *OCTET\nAn entity body is included with a request message only when the request method\ncalls for one. The presence of an entity body in a request is signaled by the\ninclusion of a Content-Length header field in the request message headers.\nHTTP/1.0 requests containing an entity body must include a valid Content-Length\nheader field.\nFor response messages, whether or not an entity body is included with a message\nis dependent on both the request method and the response code. All responses to\nthe HEAD request method must not include a body, even though the presence of\nentity header fields may lead one to believe they do. All 1xx (informational),\n204 (no content), and 304 (not modified) responses must not include a body. All\nother responses must include an entity body or a Content-Length header field\ndefined with a value of zero (0).\n*** 7.2.1 Type ***\nWhen an Entity-Body is included with a message, the data type of that body is\ndetermined via the header fields Content-Type and Content-Encoding. These\ndefine a two-layer, ordered encoding model:\n       entity-body := Content-Encoding( Content-Type( data ) )\nA Content-Type specifies the media type of the underlying data. A Content-\nEncoding may be used to indicate any additional content coding applied to the\ntype, usually for the purpose of data compression, that is a property of the\nresource requested. The default for the content encoding is none (i.e., the\nidentity function).\nAny HTTP/1.0 message containing an entity body should include a Content-Type\nheader field defining the media type of that body. If and only if the media\ntype is not given by a Content-Type header, as is the case for Simple-Response\nmessages, the recipient may attempt to guess the media type via inspection of\nits content and/or the name extension(s) of the URL used to identify the\nresource. If the media type remains unknown, the recipient should treat it as\ntype \"application/octet-stream\".\n*** 7.2.2 Length ***\nWhen an Entity-Body is included with a message, the length of that body may be\ndetermined in one of two ways. If a Content-Length header field is present, its\nvalue in bytes represents the length of the Entity-Body. Otherwise, the body\nlength is determined by the closing of the connection by the server.\nClosing the connection cannot be used to indicate the end of a request body,\nsince it leaves no possibility for the server to send back a response.\nTherefore, HTTP/1.0 requests containing an entity body must include a valid\nContent-Length header field. If a request contains an entity body and Content-\nLength is not specified, and the server does not recognize or cannot calculate\nthe length from other fields, then the server should send a 400 (bad request)\nresponse.\n     Note: Some older servers supply an invalid Content-Length when\n     sending a document that contains server-side includes dynamically\n     inserted into the data stream. It must be emphasized that this will\n     not be tolerated by future versions of HTTP. Unless the client knows\n     that it is receiving a response from a compliant server, it should\n     not depend on the Content-Length value being correct.\n***** 8. Method Definitions *****\nThe set of common methods for HTTP/1.0 is defined below. Although this set can\nbe expanded, additional methods cannot be assumed to share the same semantics\nfor separately extended clients and servers.\n**** 8.1 GET ****\nThe GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity)\nis identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing\nprocess, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the\nresponse and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be\nthe output of the process.\nThe semantics of the GET method changes to a \"conditional GET\" if the request\nmessage includes an If-Modified-Since header field. A conditional GET method\nrequests that the identified resource be transferred only if it has been\nmodified since the date given by the If-Modified-Since header, as described in\nSection_10.9. The conditional GET method is intended to reduce network usage by\nallowing cached entities to be refreshed without requiring multiple requests or\ntransferring unnecessary data.\n**** 8.2 HEAD ****\nThe HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server must not return any\nEntity-Body in the response. The metainformation contained in the HTTP headers\nin response to a HEAD request should be identical to the information sent in\nresponse to a GET request. This method can be used for obtaining\nmetainformation about the resource identified by the Request-URI without\ntransferring the Entity-Body itself. This method is often used for testing\nhypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.\nThere is no \"conditional HEAD\" request analogous to the conditional GET. If an\nIf-Modified-Since header field is included with a HEAD request, it should be\nignored.\n**** 8.3 POST ****\nThe POST method is used to request that the destination server accept the\nentity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified\nby the Request-URI in the Request-Line. POST is designed to allow a uniform\nmethod to cover the following functions:\n    * Annotation of existing resources;\n    * Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or\n      similar group of articles;\n    * Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a form[3], to\n      a data-handling process;\n    * Extending a database through an append operation.\nThe actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the server\nand is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate\nto that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to a directory\ncontaining it, a news article is subordinate to a newsgroup to which it is\nposted, or a record is subordinate to a database.\nA successful POST does not require that the entity be created as a resource on\nthe origin server or made accessible for future reference. That is, the action\nperformed by the POST method might not result in a resource that can be\nidentified by a URI. In this case, either 200 (ok) or 204 (no content) is the\nappropriate response status, depending on whether or not the response includes\nan entity that describes the result.\nIf a resource has been created on the origin server, the response should be 201\n(created) and contain an entity (preferably of type \"text/html\") which\ndescribes the status of the request and refers to the new resource.\nA valid Content-Length is required on all HTTP/1.0 POST requests. An HTTP/1.0\nserver should respond with a 400 (bad request) message if it cannot determine\nthe length of the request message's content.\nApplications must not cache responses to a POST request because the application\nhas no way of knowing that the server would return an equivalent response on\nsome future request.\n***** 9. Status Code Definitions *****\nEach Status-Code is described below, including a description of which method(s)\nit can follow and any metainformation required in the response.\n**** 9.1 Informational 1xx ****\nThis class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only of\nthe Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty line. HTTP/\n1.0 does not define any 1xx status codes and they are not a valid response to a\nHTTP/1.0 request. However, they may be useful for experimental applications\nwhich are outside the scope of this specification.\n**** 9.2 Successful 2xx ****\nThis class of status code indicates that the client's request was successfully\nreceived, understood, and accepted.\n*** 200 OK ***\nThe request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is\ndependent on the method used in the request, as follows:\n  GET\n      an entity corresponding to the requested resource is sent in the\n      response;\n  HEAD\n      the response must only contain the header information and no Entity-Body;\n  POST\n      an entity describing or containing the result of the action.\n*** 201 Created ***\nThe request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.\nThe newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s) returned in the\nentity of the response. The origin server should create the resource before\nusing this Status-Code. If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the\nserver must include in the response body a description of when the resource\nwill be available; otherwise, the server should respond with 202 (accepted).\nOf the methods defined by this specification, only POST can create a resource.\n*** 202 Accepted ***\nThe request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been\ncompleted. The request may or may not eventually be acted upon, as it may be\ndisallowed when processing actually takes place. There is no facility for re-\nsending a status code from an asynchronous operation such as this.\nThe 202 response is intentionally non-committal. Its purpose is to allow a\nserver to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a batch-oriented\nprocess that is only run once per day) without requiring that the user agent's\nconnection to the server persist until the process is completed. The entity\nreturned with this response should include an indication of the request's\ncurrent status and either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate of\nwhen the user can expect the request to be fulfilled.\n*** 204 No Content ***\nThe server has fulfilled the request but there is no new information to send\nback. If the client is a user agent, it should not change its document view\nfrom that which caused the request to be generated. This response is primarily\nintended to allow input for scripts or other actions to take place without\ncausing a change to the user agent's active document view. The response may\ninclude new metainformation in the form of entity headers, which should apply\nto the document currently in the user agent's active view.\n**** 9.3 Redirection 3xx ****\nThis class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken by\nthe user agent in order to fulfill the request. The action required may be\ncarried out by the user agent without interaction with the user if and only if\nthe method used in the subsequent request is GET or HEAD. A user agent should\nnever automatically redirect a request more than 5 times, since such\nredirections usually indicate an infinite loop.\n*** 300 Multiple Choices ***\nThis response code is not directly used by HTTP/1.0 applications, but serves as\nthe default for interpreting the 3xx class of responses.\nThe requested resource is available at one or more locations. Unless it was a\nHEAD request, the response should include an entity containing a list of\nresource characteristics and locations from which the user or user agent can\nchoose the one most appropriate. If the server has a preferred choice, it\nshould include the URL in a Location field; user agents may use this field\nvalue for automatic redirection.\n*** 301 Moved Permanently ***\nThe requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URL and any future\nreferences to this resource should be done using that URL. Clients with link\nediting capabilities should automatically relink references to the Request-URI\nto the new reference returned by the server, where possible.\nThe new URL must be given by the Location field in the response. Unless it was\na HEAD request, the Entity-Body of the response should contain a short note\nwith a hyperlink to the new URL.\nIf the 301 status code is received in response to a request using the POST\nmethod, the user agent must not automatically redirect the request unless it\ncan be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under\nwhich the request was issued.\n     Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after receiving a\n     301 status code, some existing user agents will erroneously change it\n     into a GET request.\n*** 302 Moved Temporarily ***\nThe requested resource resides temporarily under a different URL. Since the\nredirection may be altered on occasion, the client should continue to use the\nRequest-URI for future requests.\nThe URL must be given by the Location field in the response. Unless it was a\nHEAD request, the Entity-Body of the response should contain a short note with\na hyperlink to the new URI(s).\nIf the 302 status code is received in response to a request using the POST\nmethod, the user agent must not automatically redirect the request unless it\ncan be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under\nwhich the request was issued.\n     Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after receiving a\n     302 status code, some existing user agents will erroneously change it\n     into a GET request.\n*** 304 Not Modified ***\nIf the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed,\nbut the document has not been modified since the date and time specified in the\nIf-Modified-Since field, the server must respond with this status code and not\nsend an Entity-Body to the client. Header fields contained in the response\nshould only include information which is relevant to cache managers or which\nmay have changed independently of the entity's Last-Modified date. Examples of\nrelevant header fields include: Date, Server, and Expires. A cache should\nupdate its cached entity to reflect any new field values given in the 304\nresponse.\n**** 9.4 Client Error 4xx ****\nThe 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems to\nhave erred. If the client has not completed the request when a 4xx code is\nreceived, it should immediately cease sending data to the server. Except when\nresponding to a HEAD request, the server should include an entity containing an\nexplanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent\ncondition. These status codes are applicable to any request method.\n     Note: If the client is sending data, server implementations on TCP\n     should be careful to ensure that the client acknowledges receipt of\n     the packet(s) containing the response prior to closing the input\n     connection. If the client continues sending data to the server after\n     the close, the server's controller will send a reset packet to the\n     client, which may erase the client's unacknowledged input buffers\n     before they can be read and interpreted by the HTTP application.\n*** 400 Bad Request ***\nThe request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The\nclient should not repeat the request without modifications.\n*** 401 Unauthorized ***\nThe request requires user authentication. The response must include a WWW-\nAuthenticate header field (Section_10.16) containing a challenge applicable to\nthe requested resource. The client may repeat the request with a suitable\nAuthorization header field (Section_10.2). If the request already included\nAuthorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that authorization\nhas been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response contains the same\nchallenge as the prior response, and the user agent has already attempted\nauthentication at least once, then the user should be presented the entity that\nwas given in the response, since that entity may include relevant diagnostic\ninformation. HTTP access authentication is explained in Section_11.\n*** 403 Forbidden ***\nThe server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization\nwill not help and the request should not be repeated. If the request method was\nnot HEAD and the server wishes to make public why the request has not been\nfulfilled, it should describe the reason for the refusal in the entity body.\nThis status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal\nexactly why the request has been refused, or when no other response is\napplicable.\n*** 404 Not Found ***\nThe server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication is\ngiven of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. If the server does\nnot wish to make this information available to the client, the status code 403\n(forbidden) can be used instead.\n**** 9.5 Server Error 5xx ****\nResponse status codes beginning with the digit \"5\" indicate cases in which the\nserver is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the request. If\nthe client has not completed the request when a 5xx code is received, it should\nimmediately cease sending data to the server. Except when responding to a HEAD\nrequest, the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the\nerror situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These\nresponse codes are applicable to any request method and there are no required\nheader fields.\n*** 500 Internal Server Error ***\nThe server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from\nfulfilling the request.\n*** 501 Not Implemented ***\nThe server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.\nThis is the appropriate response when the server does not recognize the request\nmethod and is not capable of supporting it for any resource.\n*** 502 Bad Gateway ***\nThe server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response\nfrom the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.\n*** 503 Service Unavailable ***\nThe server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary\noverloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this is a\ntemporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay.\n     Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a\n     server must use it when becoming overloaded. Some servers may wish to\n     simply refuse the connection.\n***** 10. Header Field Definitions *****\nThis section defines the syntax and semantics of all commonly used HTTP/1.0\nheader fields. For general and entity header fields, both senderandrecipient\nrefer to either the client or the server, depending on who sends and who\nreceives the message.\n**** 10.1 Allow ****\nThe Allow entity-header field lists the set of methods supported by the\nresource identified by the Request-URI. The purpose of this field is strictly\nto inform the recipient of valid methods associated with the resource. The\nAllow header field is not permitted in a request using the POST method, and\nthus should be ignored if it is received as part of a POST entity.\n       Allow          = \"Allow\" \":\" 1#method\nExample of use:\n       Allow: GET, HEAD\nThis field cannot prevent a client from trying other methods. However, the\nindications given by the Allow header field value should be followed. The\nactual set of allowed methods is defined by the origin server at the time of\neach request.\nA proxy must not modify the Allow header field even if it does not understand\nall the methods specified, since the user agent may have other means of\ncommunicating with the origin server.\nThe Allow header field does not indicate what methods are implemented by the\nserver.\n**** 10.2 Authorization ****\nA user agent that wishes to authenticate itself with a server--usually, but not\nnecessarily, after receiving a 401 response--may do so by including an\nAuthorization request-header field with the request. The Authorization field\nvalue consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the\nuser agent for the realm of the resource being requested.\n       Authorization  = \"Authorization\" \":\" credentials\nHTTP access authentication is described in Section_11. If a request is\nauthenticated and a realm specified, the same credentials should be valid for\nall other requests within this realm.\nResponses to requests containing an Authorization field are not cachable.\n**** 10.3 Content-Encoding ****\nThe Content-Encoding entity-header field is used as a modifier to the media-\ntype. When present, its value indicates what additional content coding has been\napplied to the resource, and thus what decoding mechanism must be applied in\norder to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field. The\nContent-Encoding is primarily used to allow a document to be compressed without\nlosing the identity of its underlying media type.\n       Content-Encoding = \"Content-Encoding\" \":\" content-coding\nContent codings are defined in Section_3.5. An example of its use is\n       Content-Encoding: x-gzip\nThe Content-Encoding is a characteristic of the resource identified by the\nRequest-URI. Typically, the resource is stored with this encoding and is only\ndecoded before rendering or analogous usage.\n**** 10.4 Content-Length ****\nThe Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the Entity-Body,\nin decimal number of octets, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD\nmethod, the size of the Entity-Body that would have been sent had the request\nbeen a GET.\n       Content-Length = \"Content-Length\" \":\" 1*DIGIT\nAn example is\n       Content-Length: 3495\nApplications should use this field to indicate the size of the Entity-Body to\nbe transferred, regardless of the media type of the entity. A valid Content-\nLength field value is required on all HTTP/1.0 request messages containing an\nentity body.\nAny Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value. Section\n7.2.2 describes how to determine the length of a response entity body if a\nContent-Length is not given.\n     Note: The meaning of this field is significantly different from the\n     corresponding definition in MIME, where it is an optional field used\n     within the \"message/external-body\" content-type. In HTTP, it should\n     be used whenever the entity's length can be determined prior to being\n     transferred.\n**** 10.5 Content-Type ****\nThe Content-Type entity-header field indicates the media type of the Entity-\nBody sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the media type\nthat would have been sent had the request been a GET.\n       Content-Type   = \"Content-Type\" \":\" media-type\nMedia types are defined in Section_3.6. An example of the field is\n       Content-Type: text/html\nFurther discussion of methods for identifying the media type of an entity is\nprovided in Section_7.2.1.\n**** 10.6 Date ****\nThe Date general-header field represents the date and time at which the message\nwas originated, having the same semantics as orig-date in RFC 822. The field\nvalue is an HTTP-date, as described in Section_3.3.\n       Date           = \"Date\" \":\" HTTP-date\nAn example is\n       Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT\nIf a message is received via direct connection with the user agent (in the case\nof requests) or the origin server (in the case of responses), then the date can\nbe assumed to be the current date at the receiving end. However, since the\ndate--as it is believed by the origin--is important for evaluating cached\nresponses, origin servers should always include a Date header. Clients should\nonly send a Date header field in messages that include an entity body, as in\nthe case of the POST request, and even then it is optional. A received message\nwhich does not have a Date header field should be assigned one by the recipient\nif the message will be cached by that recipient or gatewayed via a protocol\nwhich requires a Date.\nIn theory, the date should represent the moment just before the entity is\ngenerated. In practice, the date can be generated at any time during the\nmessage origination without affecting its semantic value.\n     Note: An earlier version of this document incorrectly specified that\n     this field should contain the creation date of the enclosed Entity-\n     Body. This has been changed to reflect actual (and proper) usage.\n**** 10.7 Expires ****\nThe Expires entity-header field gives the date/time after which the entity\nshould be considered stale. This allows information providers to suggest the\nvolatility of the resource, or a date after which the information may no longer\nbe valid. Applications must not cache this entity beyond the date given. The\npresence of an Expires field does not imply that the original resource will\nchange or cease to exist at, before, or after that time. However, information\nproviders that know or even suspect that a resource will change by a certain\ndate should include an Expires header with that date. The format is an absolute\ndate and time as defined by HTTP-date in Section_3.3.\n       Expires        = \"Expires\" \":\" HTTP-date\nAn example of its use is\n       Expires: Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT\nIf the date given is equal to or earlier than the value of the Date header, the\nrecipient must not cache the enclosed entity. If a resource is dynamic by\nnature, as is the case with many data-producing processes, entities from that\nresource should be given an appropriate Expires value which reflects that\ndynamism.\nThe Expires field cannot be used to force a user agent to refresh its display\nor reload a resource; its semantics apply only to caching mechanisms, and such\nmechanisms need only check a resource's expiration status when a new request\nfor that resource is initiated.\nUser agents often have history mechanisms, such as \"Back\" buttons and history\nlists, which can be used to redisplay an entity retrieved earlier in a session.\nBy default, the Expires field does not apply to history mechanisms. If the\nentity is still in storage, a history mechanism should display it even if the\nentity has expired, unless the user has specifically configured the agent to\nrefresh expired history documents.\n     Note: Applications are encouraged to be tolerant of bad or\n     misinformed implementations of the Expires header. A value of zero\n     (0) or an invalid date format should be considered equivalent to an\n     \"expires immediately.\" Although these values are not legitimate for\n     HTTP/1.0, a robust implementation is always desirable.\n**** 10.8 From ****\nThe From request-header field, if given, should contain an Internet e-mail\naddress for the human user who controls the requesting user agent. The address\nshould be machine-usable, as defined by mailbox in RFC 822[7] (as updated by\nRFC 1123[6]):\n       From           = \"From\" \":\" mailbox\nAn example is:\n       From: webmaster@w3.org\nThis header field may be used for logging purposes and as a means for\nidentifying the source of invalid or unwanted requests. It should not be used\nas an insecure form of access protection. The interpretation of this field is\nthat the request is being performed on behalf of the person given, who accepts\nresponsibility for the method performed. In particular, robot agents should\ninclude this header so that the person responsible for running the robot can be\ncontacted if problems occur on the receiving end.\nThe Internet e-mail address in this field may be separate from the Internet\nhost which issued the request. For example, when a request is passed through a\nproxy, the original issuer's address should be used.\n     Note: The client should not send the From header field without the\n     user's approval, as it may conflict with the user's privacy interests\n     or their site's security policy. It is strongly recommended that the\n     user be able to disable, enable, and modify the value of this field\n     at any time prior to a request.\n**** 10.9 If-Modified-Since ****\nThe If-Modified-Since request-header field is used with the GET method to make\nit conditional: if the requested resource has not been modified since the time\nspecified in this field, a copy of the resource will not be returned from the\nserver; instead, a 304 (not modified) response will be returned without any\nEntity-Body.\n       If-Modified-Since = \"If-Modified-Since\" \":\" HTTP-date\nAn example of the field is:\n       If-Modified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT\nA conditional GET method requests that the identified resource be transferred\nonly if it has been modified since the date given by the If-Modified-Since\nheader. The algorithm for determining this includes the following cases:\n  a)\n      If the request would normally result in anything other than a 200 (ok)\n      status, or if the passed If-Modified-Since date is invalid, the response\n      is exactly the same as for a normal GET. A date which is later than the\n      server's current time is invalid.\n  b)\n      If the resource has been modified since the If-Modified-Since date, the\n      response is exactly the same as for a normal GET.\n  c)\n      If the resource has not been modified since a valid If-Modified-Since\n      date, the server shall return a 304 (not modified) response.\nThe purpose of this feature is to allow efficient updates of cached information\nwith a minimum amount of transaction overhead.\n**** 10.10 Last-Modified ****\nThe Last-Modified entity-header field indicates the date and time at which the\nsender believes the resource was last modified. The exact semantics of this\nfield are defined in terms of how the recipient should interpret it: if the\nrecipient has a copy of this resource which is older than the date given by the\nLast-Modified field, that copy should be considered stale.\n       Last-Modified  = \"Last-Modified\" \":\" HTTP-date\nAn example of its use is\n       Last-Modified: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 12:45:26 GMT\nThe exact meaning of this header field depends on the implementation of the\nsender and the nature of the original resource. For files, it may be just the\nfile system last-modified time. For entities with dynamically included parts,\nit may be the most recent of the set of last-modify times for its component\nparts. For database gateways, it may be the last-update timestamp of the\nrecord. For virtual objects, it may be the last time the internal state\nchanged.\nAn origin server must not send a Last-Modified date which is later than the\nserver's time of message origination. In such cases, where the resource's last\nmodification would indicate some time in the future, the server must replace\nthat date with the message origination date.\n**** 10.11 Location ****\nThe Location response-header field defines the exact location of the resource\nthat was identified by the Request-URI. For 3xx responses, the location must\nindicate the server's preferred URL for automatic redirection to the resource.\nOnly one absolute URL is allowed.\n       Location       = \"Location\" \":\" absoluteURI\nAn example is\n       Location: http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/NewLocation.html\n**** 10.12 Pragma ****\nThe Pragma general-header field is used to include implementation-specific\ndirectives that may apply to any recipient along the request/response chain.\nAll pragma directives specify optional behavior from the viewpoint of the\nprotocol; however, some systems may require that behavior be consistent with\nthe directives.\n       Pragma           = \"Pragma\" \":\" 1#pragma-directive\n       pragma-directive = \"no-cache\" | extension-pragma\n       extension-pragma = token [ \"=\" word ]\nWhen the \"no-cache\" directive is present in a request message, an application\nshould forward the request toward the origin server even if it has a cached\ncopy of what is being requested. This allows a client to insist upon receiving\nan authoritative response to its request. It also allows a client to refresh a\ncached copy which is known to be corrupted or stale.\nPragma directives must be passed through by a proxy or gateway application,\nregardless of their significance to that application, since the directives may\nbe applicable to all recipients along the request/response chain. It is not\npossible to specify a pragma for a specific recipient; however, any pragma\ndirective not relevant to a recipient should be ignored by that recipient.\n**** 10.13 Referer ****\nThe Referer request-header field allows the client to specify, for the server's\nbenefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was\nobtained. This allows a server to generate lists of back-links to resources for\ninterest, logging, optimized caching, etc. It also allows obsolete or mistyped\nlinks to be traced for maintenance. The Referer field must not be sent if the\nRequest-URI was obtained from a source that does not have its own URI, such as\ninput from the user keyboard.\n       Referer        = \"Referer\" \":\" ( absoluteURI | relativeURI )\nExample:\n       Referer: http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/Overview.html\nIf a partial URI is given, it should be interpreted relative to the Request-\nURI. The URI must not include a fragment.\n     Note: Because the source of a link may be private information or may\n     reveal an otherwise private information source, it is strongly\n     recommended that the user be able to select whether or not the\n     Referer field is sent. For example, a browser client could have a\n     toggle switch for browsing openly/anonymously, which would\n     respectively enable/disable the sending of Referer and From\n     information.\n**** 10.14 Server ****\nThe Server response-header field contains information about the software used\nby the origin server to handle the request. The field can contain multiple\nproduct tokens (Section_3.7) and comments identifying the server and any\nsignificant subproducts. By convention, the product tokens are listed in order\nof their significance for identifying the application.\n       Server         = \"Server\" \":\" 1*( product | comment )\nExample:\n       Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17\nIf the response is being forwarded through a proxy, the proxy application must\nnot add its data to the product list.\n     Note: Revealing the specific software version of the server may allow\n     the server machine to become more vulnerable to attacks against\n     software that is known to contain security holes. Server implementors\n     are encouraged to make this field a configurable option.\n     Note: Some existing servers fail to restrict themselves to the\n     product token syntax within the Server field.\n**** 10.15 User-Agent ****\nThe User-Agent request-header field contains information about the user agent\noriginating the request. This is for statistical purposes, the tracing of\nprotocol violations, and automated recognition of user agents for the sake of\ntailoring responses to avoid particular user agent limitations. Although it is\nnot required, user agents should include this field with requests. The field\ncan contain multiple product tokens (Section_3.7) and comments identifying the\nagent and any subproducts which form a significant part of the user agent. By\nconvention, the product tokens are listed in order of their significance for\nidentifying the application.\n       User-Agent     = \"User-Agent\" \":\" 1*( product | comment )\nExample:\n       User-Agent: CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3\n     Note: Some current proxy applications append their product\n     information to the list in the User-Agent field. This is not\n     recommended, since it makes machine interpretation of these fields\n     ambiguous.\n     Note: Some existing clients fail to restrict themselves to the\n     product token syntax within the User-Agent field.\n**** 10.16 WWW-Authenticate ****\nThe WWW-Authenticate response-header field must be included in 401\n(unauthorized) response messages. The field value consists of at least one\nchallenge that indicates the authentication scheme(s) and parameters applicable\nto the Request-URI.\n       WWW-Authenticate = \"WWW-Authenticate\" \":\" 1#challenge\nThe HTTP access authentication process is described in Section_11. User agents\nmust take special care in parsing the WWW-Authenticate field value if it\ncontains more than one challenge, or if more than one WWW-Authenticate header\nfield is provided, since the contents of a challenge may itself contain a\ncomma-separated list of authentication parameters.\n***** 11. Access Authentication *****\nHTTP provides a simple challenge-response authentication mechanism which may be\nused by a server to challenge a client request and by a client to provide\nauthentication information. It uses an extensible, case-insensitive token to\nidentify the authentication scheme, followed by a comma-separated list of\nattribute-value pairs which carry the parameters necessary for achieving\nauthentication via that scheme.\n       auth-scheme    = token\n       auth-param     = token \"=\" quoted-string\nThe 401 (unauthorized) response message is used by an origin server to\nchallenge the authorization of a user agent. This response must include a WWW-\nAuthenticate header field containing at least one challenge applicable to the\nrequested resource.\n       challenge      = auth-scheme 1*SP realm *( \",\" auth-param )\n       realm          = \"realm\" \"=\" realm-value\n       realm-value    = quoted-string\nThe realm attribute (case-insensitive) is required for all authentication\nschemes which issue a challenge. The realm value (case-sensitive), in\ncombination with the canonical root URL of the server being accessed, defines\nthe protection space. These realms allow the protected resources on a server to\nbe partitioned into a set of protection spaces, each with its own\nauthentication scheme and/or authorization database. The realm value is a\nstring, generally assigned by the origin server, which may have additional\nsemantics specific to the authentication scheme.\nA user agent that wishes to authenticate itself with a server--usually, but not\nnecessarily, after receiving a 401 response--may do so by including an\nAuthorization header field with the request. The Authorization field value\nconsists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user\nagent for the realm of the resource being requested.\n       credentials    = basic-credentials\n                      | ( auth-scheme #auth-param )\nThe domain over which credentials can be automatically applied by a user agent\nis determined by the protection space. If a prior request has been authorized,\nthe same credentials may be reused for all other requests within that\nprotection space for a period of time determined by the authentication scheme,\nparameters, and/or user preference. Unless otherwise defined by the\nauthentication scheme, a single protection space cannot extend outside the\nscope of its server.\nIf the server does not wish to accept the credentials sent with a request, it\nshould return a 403 (forbidden) response.\nThe HTTP protocol does not restrict applications to this simple challenge-\nresponse mechanism for access authentication. Additional mechanisms may be\nused, such as encryption at the transport level or via message encapsulation,\nand with additional header fields specifying authentication information.\nHowever, these additional mechanisms are not defined by this specification.\nProxies must be completely transparent regarding user agent authentication.\nThat is, they must forward the WWW-Authenticate and Authorization headers\nuntouched, and must not cache the response to a request containing\nAuthorization. HTTP/1.0 does not provide a means for a client to be\nauthenticated with a proxy.\n**** 11.1 Basic Authentication Scheme ****\nThe \"basic\" authentication scheme is based on the model that the user agent\nmust authenticate itself with a user-ID and a password for each realm. The\nrealm value should be considered an opaque string which can only be compared\nfor equality with other realms on that server. The server will authorize the\nrequest only if it can validate the user-ID and password for the protection\nspace of the Request-URI. There are no optional authentication parameters.\nUpon receipt of an unauthorized request for a URI within the protection space,\nthe server should respond with a challenge like the following:\n       WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"WallyWorld\"\nwhere \"WallyWorld\" is the string assigned by the server to identify the\nprotection space of the Request-URI.\nTo receive authorization, the client sends the user-ID and password, separated\nby a single colon (\":\") character, within a base64[5] encoded string in the\ncredentials.\n       basic-credentials = \"Basic\" SP basic-cookie\n       basic-cookie      = <base64_[5] encoding of userid-password,\n                            except not limited to 76 char/line>\n       userid-password   = [ token ] \":\" *TEXT\nIf the user agent wishes to send the user-ID \"Aladdin\" and password \"open\nsesame\", it would use the following header field:\n       Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nThe basic authentication scheme is a non-secure method of filtering\nunauthorized access to resources on an HTTP server. It is based on the\nassumption that the connection between the client and the server can be\nregarded as a trusted carrier. As this is not generally true on an open\nnetwork, the basic authentication scheme should be used accordingly. In spite\nof this, clients should implement the scheme in order to communicate with\nservers that use it.\n***** 12. Security Considerations *****\nThis section is meant to inform application developers, information providers,\nand users of the security limitations in HTTP/1.0 as described by this\ndocument. The discussion does not include definitive solutions to the problems\nrevealed, though it does make some suggestions for reducing security risks.\n**** 12.1 Authentication of Clients ****\nAs mentioned in Section_11.1, the Basic authentication scheme is not a secure\nmethod of user authentication, nor does it prevent the Entity-Body from being\ntransmitted in clear text across the physical network used as the carrier.\nHTTP/1.0 does not prevent additional authentication schemes and encryption\nmechanisms from being employed to increase security.\n**** 12.2 Safe Methods ****\nThe writers of client software should be aware that the software represents the\nuser in their interactions over the Internet, and should be careful to allow\nthe user to be aware of any actions they may take which may have an unexpected\nsignificance to themselves or others.\nIn particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD\nmethods should never have the significance of taking an action other than\nretrieval. These methods should be considered \"safe.\" This allows user agents\nto represent other methods, such as POST, in a special way, so that the user is\nmade aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.\nNaturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-\neffects as a result of performing a GET request; in fact, some dynamic\nresources consider that a feature. The important distinction here is that the\nuser did not request the side-effects, so therefore cannot be held accountable\nfor them.\n**** 12.3 Abuse of Server Log Information ****\nA server is in the position to save personal data about a user's requests which\nmay identify their reading patterns or subjects of interest. This information\nis clearly confidential in nature and its handling may be constrained by law in\ncertain countries. People using the HTTP protocol to provide data are\nresponsible for ensuring that such material is not distributed without the\npermission of any individuals that are identifiable by the published results.\n**** 12.4 Transfer of Sensitive Information ****\nLike any generic data transfer protocol, HTTP cannot regulate the content of\nthe data that is transferred, nor is there any a priori method of determining\nthe sensitivity of any particular piece of information within the context of\nany given request. Therefore, applications should supply as much control over\nthis information as possible to the provider of that information. Three header\nfields are worth special mention in this context: Server, Referer and From.\nRevealing the specific software version of the server may allow the server\nmachine to become more vulnerable to attacks against software that is known to\ncontain security holes. Implementors should make the Server header field a\nconfigurable option.\nThe Referer field allows reading patterns to be studied and reverse links\ndrawn. Although it can be very useful, its power can be abused if user details\nare not separated from the information contained in the Referer. Even when the\npersonal information has been removed, the Referer field may indicate a private\ndocument's URI whose publication would be inappropriate.\nThe information sent in the From field might conflict with the user's privacy\ninterests or their site's security policy, and hence it should not be\ntransmitted without the user being able to disable, enable, and modify the\ncontents of the field. The user must be able to set the contents of this field\nwithin a user preference or application defaults configuration.\nWe suggest, though do not require, that a convenient toggle interface be\nprovided for the user to enable or disable the sending of From and Referer\ninformation.\n**** 12.5 Attacks Based On File and Path Names ****\nImplementations of HTTP origin servers should be careful to restrict the\ndocuments returned by HTTP requests to be only those that were intended by the\nserver administrators. If an HTTP server translates HTTP URIs directly into\nfile system calls, the server must take special care not to serve files that\nwere not intended to be delivered to HTTP clients. For example, Unix, Microsoft\nWindows, and other operating systems use \"..\" as a path component to indicate a\ndirectory level above the current one. On such a system, an HTTP server must\ndisallow any such construct in the Request-URI if it would otherwise allow\naccess to a resource outside those intended to be accessible via the HTTP\nserver. Similarly, files intended for reference only internally to the server\n(such as access control files, configuration files, and script code) must be\nprotected from inappropriate retrieval, since they might contain sensitive\ninformation. Experience has shown that minor bugs in such HTTP server\nimplementations have turned into security risks.\n***** 13. Acknowledgments *****\nThis specification makes heavy use of the augmented BNF and generic constructs\ndefined by David H. Crocker for RFC 822[7]. Similarly, it reuses many of the\ndefinitions provided by Nathaniel Borenstein and Ned Freed for MIME[5]. We hope\nthat their inclusion in this specification will help reduce past confusion over\nthe relationship between HTTP/1.0 and Internet mail message formats.\nThe HTTP protocol has evolved considerably over the past four years. It has\nbenefited from a large and active developer community--the many people who have\nparticipated on the www-talk mailing list--and it is that community which has\nbeen most responsible for the success of HTTP and of the World-Wide Web in\ngeneral. Marc Andreessen, Robert Cailliau, Daniel W. Connolly, Bob Denny, Jean-\nFrancois Groff, Phillip M. Hallam-Baker, Håkon W. Lie, Ari Luotonen, Rob\nMcCool, Lou Montulli, Dave Raggett, Tony Sanders, and Marc VanHeyningen deserve\nspecial recognition for their efforts in defining aspects of the protocol for\nearly versions of this specification.\nPaul Hoffman contributed sections regarding the informational status of this\ndocument and Appendices C and D.\nThis document has benefited greatly from the comments of all those\nparticipating in the HTTP-WG.

Internet Media Type message/http *****\nIn addition to defining the HTTP/1.0 protocol, this document serves as the\nspecification for the Internet media type \"message/http\". The following is to\nbe registered with IANA[13].\n       Media Type name:         message\n\n       Media subtype name:      http\n\n       Required parameters:     none\n\n       Optional parameters:     version, msgtype\n\n              version: The HTTP-Version number of the enclosed message\n                       (e.g., \"1.0\"). If not present, the version can be\n                       determined from the first line of the body.\n\n              msgtype: The message type -- \"request\" or \"response\". If not\n                       present, the type can be determined from the first\n                       line of the body.\n\n       Encoding considerations: only \"7bit\", \"8bit\", or \"binary\" are\n                                permitted\n\n       Security considerations: none\n***** B. Tolerant Applications *****\nAlthough this document specifies the requirements for the generation of HTTP/\n1.0 messages, not all applications will be correct in their implementation. We\ntherefore recommend that operational applications be tolerant of deviations\nwhenever those deviations can be interpreted unambiguously.\nClients should be tolerant in parsing the Status-Line and servers tolerant when\nparsing the Request-Line. In particular, they should accept any amount of SP or\nHT characters between fields, even though only a single SP is required.\nThe line terminator for HTTP-header fields is the sequence CRLF. However, we\nrecommend that applications, when parsing such headers, recognize a single LF\nas a line terminator and ignore the leading CR.\n***** C. Relationship to MIME *****\nHTTP/1.0 uses many of the constructs defined for Internet Mail (RFC 822[7]) and\nthe Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME[5]) to allow entities to be\ntransmitted in an open variety of representations and with extensible\nmechanisms. However, RFC 1521 discusses mail, and HTTP has a few features that\nare different than those described in RFC 1521. These differences were\ncarefully chosen to optimize performance over binary connections, to allow\ngreater freedom in the use of new media types, to make date comparisons easier,\nand to acknowledge the practice of some early HTTP servers and clients.\nAt the time of this writing, it is expected that RFC 1521 will be revised. The\nrevisions may include some of the practices found in HTTP/1.0 but not in RFC\n1521.\nThis appendix describes specific areas where HTTP differs from RFC 1521.\nProxies and gateways to strict MIME environments should be aware of these\ndifferences and provide the appropriate conversions where necessary. Proxies\nand gateways from MIME environments to HTTP also need to be aware of the\ndifferences because some conversions may be required.\n**** C.1 Conversion to Canonical Form ****\nRFC 1521 requires that an Internet mail entity be converted to canonical form\nprior to being transferred, as described in Appendix G of RFC 1521[5]. Section\n3.6.1 of this document describes the forms allowed for subtypes of the \"text\"\nmedia type when transmitted over HTTP.\nRFC 1521 requires that content with a Content-Type of \"text\" represent line\nbreaks as CRLF and forbids the use of CR or LF outside of line break sequences.\nHTTP allows CRLF, bare CR, and bare LF to indicate a line break within text\ncontent when a message is transmitted over HTTP.\nWhere it is possible, a proxy or gateway from HTTP to a strict RFC 1521\nenvironment should translate all line breaks within the text media types\ndescribed in Section_3.6.1 of this document to the RFC 1521 canonical form of\nCRLF. Note, however, that this may be complicated by the presence of a Content-\nEncoding and by the fact that HTTP allows the use of some character sets which\ndo not use octets 13 and 10 to represent CR and LF, as is the case for some\nmulti-byte character sets.\n**** C.2 Conversion of Date Formats ****\nHTTP/1.0 uses a restricted set of date formats (Section_3.3) to simplify the\nprocess of date comparison. Proxies and gateways from other protocols should\nensure that any Date header field present in a message conforms to one of the\nHTTP/1.0 formats and rewrite the date if necessary.\n**** C.3 Introduction of Content-Encoding ****\nRFC 1521 does not include any concept equivalent to HTTP/1.0's Content-Encoding\nheader field. Since this acts as a modifier on the media type, proxies and\ngateways from HTTP to MIME-compliant protocols must either change the value of\nthe Content-Type header field or decode the Entity-Body before forwarding the\nmessage. (Some experimental applications of Content-Type for Internet mail have\nused a media-type parameter of \";conversions=<content-coding>\" to perform an\nequivalent function as Content-Encoding. However, this parameter is not part of\nRFC 1521.)\n**** C.4 No Content-Transfer-Encoding ****\nHTTP does not use the Content-Transfer-Encoding (CTE) field of RFC 1521.\nProxies and gateways from MIME-compliant protocols to HTTP must remove any non-\nidentity CTE (\"quoted-printable\" or \"base64\") encoding prior to delivering the\nresponse message to an HTTP client.\nProxies and gateways from HTTP to MIME-compliant protocols are responsible for\nensuring that the message is in the correct format and encoding for safe\ntransport on that protocol, where \"safe transport\" is defined by the\nlimitations of the protocol being used. Such a proxy or gateway should label\nthe data with an appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding if doing so will improve\nthe likelihood of safe transport over the destination protocol.\n**** C.5 HTTP Header Fields in Multipart Body-Parts ****\nIn RFC 1521, most header fields in multipart body-parts are generally ignored\nunless the field name begins with \"Content-\". In HTTP/1.0, multipart body-parts\nmay contain any HTTP header fields which are significant to the meaning of that\npart.\n***** D. Additional Features *****\nThis appendix documents protocol elements used by some existing HTTP\nimplementations, but not consistently and correctly across most HTTP/1.0\napplications. Implementors should be aware of these features, but cannot rely\nupon their presence in, or interoperability with, other HTTP/1.0 applications.\n**** D.1 Additional Request Methods ****\n*** D.1.1 PUT ***\nThe PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied\nRequest-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the\nenclosed entity should be considered as a modified version of the one residing\non the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing\nresource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the\nrequesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.\nThe fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is reflected in\nthe different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a POST request identifies\nthe resource that will handle the enclosed entity as data to be processed. That\nresource may be a data-accepting process, a gateway to some other protocol, or\na separate entity that accepts annotations. In contrast, the URI in a PUT\nrequest identifies the entity enclosed with the request -- the user agent knows\nwhat URI is intended and the server should not apply the request to some other\nresource.\n*** D.1.2 DELETE ***\nThe DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource\nidentified by the Request-URI.\n*** D.1.3 LINK ***\nThe LINK method establishes one or more Link relationships between the existing\nresource identified by the Request-URI and other existing resources.\n*** D.1.4 UNLINK ***\nThe UNLINK method removes one or more Link relationships from the existing\nresource identified by the Request-URI.\n**** D.2 Additional Header Field Definitions ****\n*** D.2.1 Accept ***\nThe Accept request-header field can be used to indicate a list of media ranges\nwhich are acceptable as a response to the request. The asterisk \"*\" character\nis used to group media types into ranges, with \"*/*\" indicating all media types\nand \"type/*\" indicating all subtypes of that type. The set of ranges given by\nthe client should represent what types are acceptable given the context of the\nrequest.\n*** D.2.2 Accept-Charset ***\nThe Accept-Charset request-header field can be used to indicate a list of\npreferred character sets other than the default US-ASCII and ISO-8859-1. This\nfield allows clients capable of understanding more comprehensive or special-\npurpose character sets to signal that capability to a server which is capable\nof representing documents in those character sets.\n*** D.2.3 Accept-Encoding ***\nThe Accept-Encoding request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts\nthe content-coding values which are acceptable in the response.\n*** D.2.4 Accept-Language ***\nThe Accept-Language request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts\nthe set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the request.\n*** D.2.5 Content-Language ***\nThe Content-Language entity-header field describes the natural language(s) of\nthe intended audience for the enclosed entity. Note that this may not be\nequivalent to all the languages used within the entity.\n*** D.2.6 Link ***\nThe Link entity-header field provides a means for describing a relationship\nbetween the entity and some other resource. An entity may include multiple Link\nvalues. Links at the metainformation level typically indicate relationships\nlike hierarchical structure and navigation paths.\n*** D.2.7 MIME-Version ***\nHTTP messages may include a single MIME-Version general-header field to\nindicate what version of the MIME protocol was used to construct the message.\nUse of the MIME-Version header field, as defined by RFC 1521[5], should\nindicate that the message is MIME-conformant. Unfortunately, some older HTTP/\n1.0 servers send it indiscriminately, and thus this field should be ignored.\n*** D.2.8 Retry-After ***\nThe Retry-After response-header field can be used with a 503 (service\nunavailable) response to indicate how long the service is expected to be\nunavailable to the requesting client. The value of this field can be either an\nHTTP-date or an integer number of seconds (in decimal) after the time of the\nresponse.\n*** D.2.9 Title ***\nThe Title entity-header field indicates the
